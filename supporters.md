#DFKI

The German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI GmbH), with facilities in Kaiserslautern, Saarbrücken and Bremen, is the country's leading research center in the area of innovative software technology for commercial application. In the international scientific community, DFKI is recognized as one of the most important „Centers of Excellence“ in the world for its proven ability to rapidly bring leading edge research to commercially relevant application solutions.

DFKI was founded in 1988 as a nonprofit organization by several renowned German IT companies and the merger of two large, research facilities. Since then, DFKI GmbH has established a reputation for proactive and customer oriented work and is known both nationally and internationally as a competent and reliable partner for commercial innovation.

Because of the increasingly short cycles of innovation in the field of information technology, the lines between research, application related development, and conversion to products are becoming blurred. This is why DFKI projects typically include the entire spectrum from basic application-based research to market and customer oriented development of product functions.
