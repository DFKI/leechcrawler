                       Welcome to the RAR Archiver!

 Introduction
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~

    RAR is a powerful tool which allows you to manage and control archive
  files. The archive is usually a regular file, which name has a ".rar"
  suffix.

  RAR features include:-

    *  Highly sophisticated, original compression algorithm
    *  Special compression algorithms optimized for text, audio,
       graphics data, 32 and 64-bit Intel executables
    *  Better compression than similar tools, using 'solid' archiving
    *  Authenticity verification (registered version only)
    *  Self-extracting archives and volumes (SFX)
    *  Ability to recover physically damaged archives
    *  Locking, password, file order list, file security & more ...


 Configuration file
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  RAR for Unix reads configuration information from the file .rarrc
  in the user's home directory (stored in HOME environment variable)
  or in /etc directory.

  RAR for Windows reads configuration information from the file rar.ini,
  placed in the same directory as the rar.exe file.

  This file may contain the following string:

  switches=<any RAR switches, separated with a space>


 Environment variable
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Default parameters may be added to the RAR command line by establishing
    an environment variable "RAR".

    For instance, in UNIX following lines may be added to your profile:

      RAR='-s -md1024'
      export RAR

    RAR will use this string as default parameters in the command line and
    will create "solid" archives with 1024 KB sliding dictionary size.

    RAR handles options with priority as following:

       command line switches                   highest priority
       switches in the RAR variable            lower priority
       switches saved in configuration file    lowest priority


 Log file
 ~~~~~~~~

  If the switch -ilog is specified in the command line or configuration
  file, RAR will write informational messages, concerning errors
  encountered while processing archives, to a log file. In Unix
  this file is named .rarlog and placed in the user's home directory.
  In Windows it is named rar.log and placed in the same directory as
  the rar.exe file. Switch -ilog allows to override the default log name.


 The file order list for solid archiving - rarfiles.lst
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  rarfiles.lst contains user-defined file list which tells RAR
  the order to add files to a solid archive. It may contain file
  names, wildcards and special entry - $default. The default
  entry defines the place in order list for files not matched
  with other entries in this file. The comment character is ';'.

  In Windows this file should be placed in the same directory as RAR,
  in Unix - to the user's home directory or to /etc.

  Tips to provide improved compression and speed of operation:

  - similar files should be grouped together in the archive;
  - frequently accessed files should be placed at the beginning.


 RAR command line syntax
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Syntax

    RAR <command>  [ -<switches> ]  <archive>  [ <@listfiles...> ]
        [ <files...> ]  [ <path_to_extract\> ]

 Description

    Command line options (commands and switches) provides control of
    creating and managing archives with RAR. The command is a string (or a
    single letter) which commands RAR to perform a corresponding action.
    Switches are designed to modify the way RAR performs the action. Other
    parameters are archive name and files to be archived into or extracted
    from the archive.

    Listfiles are plain text files contained names of files to process.
    File names should start at the first column. It is possible to
    put comments to the listfile after // characters. For example,
    you may create backup.lst containing the following strings:

    c:\work\doc\*.txt         //backup text documents
    c:\work\image\*.bmp       //backup pictures
    c:\work\misc

    and then run:

       rar a backup @backup.lst

    If you wish to read file names from stdin (standard input),
    specify the empty listfile name (just @).

    You may specify both usual file names and list files in the same
    command line. If neither files nor listfiles are specified,
    then *.* is implied and RAR will process all files

    In a UNIX environment you need to quote wildcards to avoid them being
    processed by RAR itself. For example, this command will extract
    *.asm files from RAR archives in current path:

       rar e '*.rar' '*.asm'


    Command could be any of the following:

    a       Add files to archive.

            Example:

            create or update existent archive myarch, adding all files
            in the current directory

            rar a myarch


    c       Add archive comment. Comments are displayed while the archive is
            being processed. Comment length is limited to 62000 bytes

            Examples:

            rar c distrib.rar

            Also comments may be added from a file:

            rar c -zinfo.txt dummy


    cf      Add files comment. File comments are displayed when the 'v'
            command is given. File comment length is limited to 32767 bytes.

            Example:

            rar cf bigarch *.txt


    cw      Write archive comment to specified file.

            Example:

            rar cw oldarch comment.txt


    d       Delete files from archive. Note, if the processing of this
            command resulted in removing all the files from the archive, the
            empty archive would removed.


    e       Extract files to current directory.


    f       Freshen files in archive. Updates those files changed since they
            were packed to the archive. This command will not add new files
            to the archive.


    k       Lock archive. Any command which intends to change the archive
            will be ignored.

            Example:

            rar k final.rar


    l[t]    List contents of archive [technical]. Files are listed as with
            the 'v' command with the exception of the file path. i.e. only
            the file name is displayed. Optional technical information
            (host OS, solid flag and old version flag) is displayed
            when 't' modifier is used.


    m[f]    Move to archive [files only]. Moving files and directories
            results in the files and directories being erased upon
            successful completion of the packing operation. Directories will
            not be removed if 'f' modifier is used and/or '-ed' switch is
            applied.


    p       Print file to stdout.


    r       Repair archive. Archive repairing is performed in two stages.
            First, the damaged archive is searched for a recovery record
            (see 'rr' command). If the archive contains a recovery record
            and if the portion of the damaged data is continuous and less
            than N*512 bytes, where N is number of recovery sectors placed
            into the archive, the chance of successful archive
            reconstruction is very high. When this stage has completed, a
            new archive will be created, called _RECOVER.RAR.

            If a broken archive does not contain a recovery record or if
            the archive is not completely recovered due to major damage, a
            second stage is performed. During this stage only the archive
            structure is reconstructed and it is impossible to recover
            files which fail the CRC validation, it is still possible to
            recover undamaged files which were inaccessible due to the
            broken archive structure. Mostly this is useful for non-solid
            archives.

            When the second stage is completed, the reconstructed archive
            will be saved as _RECONST.RAR.

            While the recovery is in progress, RAR may prompt the user for
            assistance when a suspicious file is detected.

                      Suspicious entry

              Name:  <possibly filename>
              Size:  <size>    Packed: <compressed size>

                      Add it: Yes/No/All

            Answer 'y' to add this entry to the file _RECOVER.RAR.

            Example:

            rar r buggy.rar


    rc      Reconstruct missing volumes using recovery volumes
            (.rev files). You need to specify any existing volume
            as the archive name, for example, 'rar rc backup.part03.rar'

            Read 'rv' command description for information about
            recovery volumes.


    rr[N]   Add data recovery record. Optionally, redundant information
            (recovery record) may be added to an archive.  This will cause
            a small increase of the archive size and helps to recover
            archived files in case of floppy disk failure or data losses of
            any other kind. A recovery record contains up to 32768 recovery
            sectors. The number of sectors may be specified directly in the
            'rr' command (N = 1, 2 .. 32768) or if it is not specified by the
            user it will be selected automatically according to the archive
            size: a size of the recovery information will be about 1%
            of the total archive size, usually allowing the recovery of
            up to 0.6% of the total archive size of continuously damaged data.

            It is also possible to specify the recovery record size in
            percent to the archive size. Just append the percent character
            to the command parameter. For example:

            rar rr3% arcname

            Note that if you run this command from .bat or .cmd file,
            you need to use rr3%% instead of rr3%, because the command
            processor treats the single '%' character as start of
            batch file parameter. You may also use 'p' instead of '%',
            so 'rr3p' will work too.

            If data are damaged continuously then each rr-sector helps to
            recover 512 bytes of damaged information. This value may be
            lower in cases of multiple damage.

            The size of the recovery record may be approximately determined
            by the formula <archive size>/256 + <number of recovery
            sectors>*512 bytes.


    rv[N]   Create recovery volumes (.rev files), which can be later
            used to reconstruct missing files in a volume set.
            This command has sense only for multivolume archives
            and you need to specify a name of the first volume
            in the set as the archive name. For example:

            rar rv3 data.part01.rar

            This feature may be useful for backups or, for example,
            when you posted a multivolume archive to a newsgroup
            and a part of subscribers did not receive some files.
            Reposting recovery volumes instead of usual volumes
            may reduce a total number of files to repost.

            Each recovery volume is able to reconstruct one missing
            RAR volume. For example, if you have 30 volumes and
            3 recovery volumes, you are able to reconstruct any
            3 missing volumes. If number of .rev files is less than
            number of missing volumes, reconstructing is impossible.
            Total number of usual and recovery volumes must not
            exceed 255.

            The optional <N> parameter specifies a number of recovery
            volumes to create and must be less than the total number
            of RAR volumes in the set. You may also append a percent
            character to this parameter, in such case the number of
            creating .rev files will be equal to this percent taken
            from the total number of RAR volumes. For example:

            rar rv15% data.part01.rar

            RAR reconstructs missing volumes either when using 'rc'
            command or automatically, if it cannot locate the next
            volume and finds the required number of .rev files
            when unpacking.

            Recovery volumes cannot correct damaged RAR files, but only
            completely reconstruct missing ones, so if your volume
            is corrupt and you want to repair it using recovery volumes,
            just delete it and then run 'rc' command.

            If recovery volume itself is corrupt, the result of
            reconstructing is undefined. It is even possible that
            a reconstructed volume will be also corrupt without any
            warning when performing reconstructing.

            Names of recovery volumes contain information important
            for reconstruction (the total number of usual and recovery
            volumes and the number of concrete recovery volume).
            You must not rename usual or recovery volumes after they
            were created, otherwise RAR will not able to reconstruct
            them later.
            

    s[name] Convert archive to SFX. The archive is merged with SFX-module
            (using a module in file default.sfx or specified in the switch).
            In the Windows version default.sfx should be placed in the
            same directory as the rar.exe, in Unix - in the user's
            home directory, in /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib.

    s-      Remove SFX module from the already existing SFX archive.
            RAR creates a new archive without SFX module, the original
            SFX archive is not deleted.

    t       Test archive files. This command performs a dummy file
            extraction, writing nothing to the output stream, in order to
            validate the specified file(s).

            Examples:

            Test archives in current directory:

            rar t *

            or for Unix:

            rar t '*'

            User may test archives in all sub-directories, starting
            with the current path:

            rar t -r *

            or for Unix:

            rar t -r '*'


    u       Update files in archive. Adds files not already in the archive
            and updates files changed since they were packed to the archive.


    v[t]    Verbosely list the contents of archive [technical].
            Files are listed using the format: full pathname, file comment,
            original and compressed size, compression ratio, last update
            date and time, attributes, CRC, compression method and minimum
            RAR version required to extract. Optional technical information
            (host OS, solid flag and old file version flag) is displayed
            when 't' modifier is used.

            To list the contents of all archive volumes, use an asterisk
            ('*') in place of the archive file extension or use the '-v'
            switch.

            Example:

            direct archive content list (technical) to a file

            rar vt bambam >bambam.lst


    x       Extract files with full path.

            Example:

            rar x -av- -c- dime 10cents.txt

            extract specified file to current path. AV check and comment
            show are disabled.


    Switches (used in conjunction with a command):


    -?      Display help on commands and switches. The same as when none
            or an illegal command line option is entered.


    --      Stop switches scanning

            This switch tells to RAR that there is no more switches
            in the command line. It could be useful, if either archive
            or file name starts from '-' character. Without '--' switch
            such name would be treated as switch.

            Example:

            add all files from the current directory to the solid archive
            '-StrangeName'

            RAR a -s -- -StrangeName

    -ac     Clear Archive attribute after compression or extraction
            (Windows version only).


    -ad     Append archive name to destination path.

            This option may be useful when unpacking a group of archives.
            By default RAR places files from all archives to the same
            directory, but this switch creates a separate directory
            for files unpacked from each archive.

            Example:

            rar x -ad *.rar data\

            RAR will create for every unpacking archive subdirectories
            below 'data'.


    -ag[format]
            Generate archive name using the current date and time.

            Appends the current date string to an archive name when
            creating an archive. Useful for daily backups.

            Format of the appending string is defined by the optional
            "format" parameter or by "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS" if this parameter
            is absent. Format string may include the following characters:

            Y   - year
            M   - month
            MMM - month name as text string (Jan, Feb, etc.)
            W   - a week number (a week starts with Monday)
            A   - day of week number (Monday is 1, Sunday - 7)
            D   - day of month
            E   - day of year
            H   - hours
            M   - minutes (treated as minutes if encountered after hours)
            S   - seconds

            If the first character in the format string is '+', positions
            of the date string and base archive name are exchanged,
            so date will precede an archive name.

            All other characters are added to an archive name without
            changes.

            Examples:

            1) use the default YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format

               rar a -ag backup

            2) use DD-MMM-YY format

               rar a -agDD-MMM-YY backup

            3) use YYYYMMDDHHMM format, place date before 'backup'

               rar a -ag+YYYYMMDDHHMM backup

            4) use YYYY-WW-A format

               rar a -agYYYY-WW-A backup


    -ao     Add files with Archive attribute set
            (Windows version only).

            Example:

            add all disk C: files with Archive attribute set
            to the 'f:backup' and clear files Archive attribute

            rar a -r -ac -ao f:backup c:\*.*


    -ap     Set path inside archive. This path is merged to file
            names when adding files to an archive and removed
            from file names when extracting.

            For example, if you wish to add the file 'readme.txt'
            to the directory 'DOCS\ENG' of archive 'release',
            you may run:

            rar a -apDOCS\ENG release readme.txt

            or to extract 'ENG' to the current directory:

            rar x -apDOCS release DOCS\ENG\*.*


    -as     Synchronize archive contents

            If this switch is used when archiving, those archived files
            which are not present in the list of the currently added
            files, will be deleted from archive. It is convenient to use
            this switch in combination with -u (update) to synchronize
            contents of an archive and an archiving directory.

            For example, after the command:

            rar a -u -as backup sources\*.cpp

            the archive 'backup.rar' will contain only *.cpp files
            from directory 'sources', all other files will be deleted
            from the archive. It looks similar to creating a new archive,
            but with the one important exception: if no files are
            modified since a last backup, the operation is performed
            much faster than creation of a new archive.


    -av     Put authenticity verification (registered versions only).
            RAR will put, in every new and updated archive, information
            concerning the creator, last update time and archive name.

            If an archive, containing authenticity verification, is being
            modified and this switch is not specified, the authenticity
            verification information will be removed.

            When extracting, testing, listing or updating and archive with
            the '-av' switch, RAR will perform integrity validation and
            display the message:

              Verifying authenticity information ...

            In the case of successful authenticity verification, the message
            'Ok', creator name and last update information will be
            displayed. In the case of authenticity verification failure, the
            message 'FAILED' will be displayed.

            The Authenticity Verification feature, '-av,' is recommended for
            use with archives in a software distribution environment.

            In order to enable the Authenticity verification feature, the
            program MUST be registered. Please contact your local
            distribution site or the world-wide distribution center.


    -av-    Disable authenticity verification checking or adding.


    -cfg-   Disable read configuration and environment.


    -cl     Convert file names to lower case.


    -cu     Convert file names to upper case.


    -c-     Disable comments show.


    -df     Delete files after archiving

            Move files to archive. This switch in combination with
            the command "A" performs the same action as the command "M".
           

    -dh     Open shared files

            Allows to process files opened by other applications
            for writing.

            This option could be dangerous, because it allows
            to archive a file, which at the same time is modifying
            by an other application, so use it carefully.


    -ds     Do not sort files while adding to a solid archive.


    -ed     Do not add empty directories

            This switch indicates that empty directories are not to be
            stored in the created archive.


    -ee     Do not process extended attributes

            Disables saving and restoring extended file attributes.
            Only for OS/2 versions.


    -en     Do not add "end of archive" block

            By default, RAR adds "end of archive" block to the end of new
            or updated archive. It allows to skip external data like
            digital signatures safely, but in some special cases it may be
            useful to disable this feature. For example, if an archive
            is transferred between two systems via a unreliable link and
            at the same time a sender adds new files to it, it may be
            important to be sure that the already received file part will
            not be modified on the other end between transfer sessions.

            This switch cannot be used with volumes, because the end
            of archive block contains information important for correct
            volume processing. 


    -ep     Exclude paths from names. This switch enables files to be added
            to an archive without including the path information. This
            could, of course, result in multiple files existing in the
            archive with the same name.


    -ep1    Exclude base dir from names. Do not store the path entered in
            the command line.

            Example:

            all files and directories from the directory tmp will be added
            to the archive 'test', but the path in archived names will not
            include 'tmp\'

            rar a -ep1 -r test tmp\*

            This is equivalent to the commands:

            cd tmp
            rar a -r ..\test
            cd ..


    -ep2    Expand paths to full. Store full file paths (except a drive
            letter and leading path separator) when archiving.
    

    -e<atr> Specifies file exclude attributes mask. <atr> is a number in the
            decimal, octal (with leading '0') or hex (with leading '0x')
            format. If result of bitwise AND between <atr> and file
            attributes is nonzero, then file would not be added to archive.

            In the Windows version also is possible to use instead of
            digital mask symbols D, S, H, A and R to denote directories
            and files with system, hidden, archive and read-only attributes.
            The order in which the attributes are given is not significant.


    -f      Freshen files. May be used with archive extraction or creation.
            The command string "a -f" is equivalent to the command 'f', you
            could also use the switch '-f' with the commands 'm' or 'mf'. If
            the switch '-f' is used with the commands 'x' or 'e', then only
            old files would be replaced with new versions extracted from the
            archive.


    -hp[p]  Encrypt both file data and headers.

            This switch is similar to -p[p], but switch -p encrypts
            only file data and leaves other information like file names
            visible. This switch encrypts all sensitive archive areas
            include file data, file names, sizes, attributes, comments
            and other blocks, so it provides a higher security level.
            Without a password it is impossible to view even the list of
            files in archive encrypted with -hp.

            Example:

            rar a -hpfGzq5yKw secret report.txt

            will add the file report.txt to the encrypted archive
            secret.rar using the password 'fGzq5yKw'


    -idp    Disable percentage indicator.

            May be useful when redirecting output to a file.


    -ieml[.][addr]
            Send archive by email. Win32 version only.

            Attach an archive created or updated by the add command
            to email message. You need to have MAPI compliant email
            client to use this switch (most modern email programs
            support MAPI interface).

            You may enter a destination email address directly
            in the switch or leave it blank. In the latter case it
            will be asked by your email program. It is possible to
            specify several addresses separated with commas or
            semicolons.

            If you append a dot character to -ieml, an archive will be
            deleted after it was successfully attached to email.
            If the switch is used when creating a multivolume archive,
            every volume is attached to separate email message.


    -ierr   Send all messages to stderr.


    -ilog[name]
            Log errors to file (registered version only).

            Write error messages to the file rar.log created in RAR
            directory. It is possible to specify another log file name
            instead of the default rar.log in the switch, for example,
            -ilogc:\log\backup.log. If the specifed name does not
            include path, the log file will be created in RAR directory.


    -inul   Disable all messages.


    -isnd   Enable sound.


    -k      Lock archive. Any command which intends to change the archive
            will be ignored.


    -kb     Keep broken extracted files.

            RAR, by default, deletes files with CRC errors after
            extraction. The switch -kb specifies that files with
            CRC errors should not be deleted.


    -m<n>   Set compression method:

       -m0   store     do not compress file when adding to archive
       -m1   fastest   use fastest method (less compressive)
       -m2   fast      use fast compression method
       -m3   normal    use normal (default) compression method
       -m4   good      use good compression method (more
                       compressive, but slower)
       -m5   best      use best compression method (slightly more
                       compressive, but slowest)

            If this switch is not specified, RAR uses -m3 method
            (normal compression).

            By default, RAR uses only the general compression
            algorithm in -m1 and -m2 methods, advanced algorithms
            like audio and true color processing are enabled
            only in -m3..-m5 modes, the advanced text compression
            is activated only in -m4..-m5. This default can be
            overridden using -mc switch.


    -mc<par>
            Set advanced compression parameters.

            This switch is intended mainly for benchmarking and
            experiments, in the real environment usually it is better
            to allow RAR to select optimal parameters automatically.
            Please note that improper use of this switch may lead
            to very serious performance and compression loss, so use
            it only if you clearly understand what you do.

            It has the following syntax:

            -mc[param1][:param2][module][+ or -]

            where <module> is the one character field denoting a part
            of the compression algorithm, which has to be configured.

            It may have the following values:

              A       - audio compression;
              C       - true color (RGB) data compression;
              D       - delta compression;
              E       - 32-bit x86 executables compression;
              I       - 64-bit Intel Itanium executables compression;
              T       - text compression.

            '+' sign at the end of switch applies the selected algorithm
            module to all processed data, '-' disables the module at all.
            If no sign is specified, RAR will choose modules automatically,
            basing on data and the current compression method.

            Switch -mc- disables all optional modules and allows only
            the general compression algorithm.

            <Param1> and <Param2> are module dependent parameters
            described below.

            Audio compression, delta compression:

            <Param1> is a number of byte channels (can be 1 - 31).
            RAR splits multibyte channels to bytes, for example,
            two 16-bit audio channels are considered by RAR as four
            channels one byte each.

            <Param2> is ignored.


            32-bit x86 Intel executables compression,
            64-bit Intel Itanium executables compression,
            true color (RGB) data compression:

            <Param1> and <Param2> are ignored.


            Text compression: 

            <Param1> is the order of PPM algorithm (can be 2 - 63).
            Usually a higher value slightly increases the compression ratio
            of redundant data, but only if enough memory is available
            to PPM. In case of lack of memory the result may be negative.
            Higher order values decrease both compression and decompression
            speed.

            <Param2> is memory in megabytes allocated for PPM (1-128).
            Higher values may increase the compression ratio, but note
            that PPM uses the equal memory size both to compress and
            decompress, so if you allocate too much memory when creating
            an archive, other people may have problems when decompressing
            it on a computer with less memory installed. Decompression
            will be still possible using virtual memory, but it may
            become very slow.


            Examples:

            1) switch -mc1a+ forces use of 8-bit mono audio compression
            for all data.

            2) switch -mc10:40t+ forces use of text compression
            algorithm for all data, sets the compression order to 10
            and allocates 40 MB memory.

            3) switch -mc12t sets the text compression order to 12,
            when the text compression is used, but leaves to RAR to
            decide when to use it.

            4) switches -mct- -mcd- disable text and delta compression.


    -md<n>  Select dictionary size <n> in KB. Must be 64, 128, 256, 512,
            1024, 2048 or 4096 or a letter 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'
            respectively.

            The sliding dictionary is a special memory area used by the
            compression algorithm. If the size of the file being compressed
            (or the total files size in the case of a solid archive) is
            greater than the dictionary size, then increasing the dictionary
            size will generally increase compression ratio, decrease packing
            speed and increase memory requirements.

            RAR can reduce the dictionary size if it is significantly
            larger than size of source data. It helps to reduce memory
            requirements without decreasing compression.

            Default sliding dictionary size is 4096 KB.

            Example:

            RAR a -s -mdd sources *.asm
                or
            RAR a -s -md512 sources *.asm

            Will create a solid archive using a 512 KB dictionary.


    -ms[list]
            Specify file types to store.

            Specify file types, which will be stored without compression.
            This switch may be used to store already compressed files,
            what helps to increase archiving speed without noticeable loss
            in the compression ratio.

            Optional <list> parameter defines the list of file extensions
            separated with a semicolon. For example, -msrar;zip;jpg will
            force RAR to store without compression all RAR and ZIP
            archives and JPG images. It is also allowed to specify wildcard
            file masks in the list, so -ms*.rar;*.zip;*.jpg will work too.

            If <list> is not specified, -ms switch will use the default
            set of extensions, which includes the following file types:

            ace, arj, bz2, cab, gz, jpeg, jpg, lha, lzh, mp3,
            rar, zip, taz, tgz, z


    -ol     Save symbolic links as the link instead of the file.
            Unix version only.


    -os     Save NTFS streams. Win32 version only.

            This switch has meaning only for NTFS file system under
            Windows NT and allows to save alternative data streams
            associated with a file. It is especially important under
            Windows 2000, which uses streams to keep some file dependent
            information like file descriptions. If you use RAR to backup
            your NTFS disks, it is recommended to specify this switch.


    -ow     Use this switch when archiving to save file security
            information and when extracting to restore it.

            Unix RAR version saves file owner and group when using
            this switch.

            Win32 version stores owner, group, file permissions and
            audit information, but only if you have necessary privileges
            to read them. Note that only NTFS file system supports
            file based security under Windows.

    -o+     Overwrite existing files.


    -o-     Do not overwrite existing files.


    -p[p]   Encrypt files with the string <p> as password while archiving.
            The password is case-sensitive. If you omit the password on the
            command line, you will be prompted with message "Enter password".

            Example:

            rar a -pmyhoney secret1 *.txt

            add files *.txt and encrypt them with password "myhoney".


    -p-     Do not query password


    -r      Recurse subdirectories. May be used with commands:
            a, u, f, m, x, e, t, p, v, l, c, cf and s.

            When used with the commands 'a', 'u', 'f', 'm' will process
            files in all sub-directories as well as the current working
            directory.

            When used with the commands x, e, t, p, v, l, c, cf or s will
            process all archives in sub-directories as well as the current
            working directory.


    -r0     Similar to -r, but when used with the commands 'a', 'u', 'f',
            'm' will recurse subdirectories only for those names, which
            include wildcard characters '*' and '?'


    -ri<p>[:<s>]
            Set priority and sleep time. Available only in RAR for Windows.
            This switch is used to regulate system load by RAR in a
            multitasking environment. The possible task priority values are
            from 0 to 15. When <p> is equal to 0, the default task priority
            is used, 1 corresponding to the lowest task priority, 15 - to
            the highest. The sleep time <s> is a value from 0 to 1000
            (milliseconds). This is the period of time that RAR will give
            back to system after every read or write during the packing or
            unpacking operation. The sleep time setting is useful when
            several tasks with the same priority are running in the system.

            Example:

            execute RAR with default priority and 10 ms of sleep after
            each read or write

            rar a -r -sfx -ri0:10 backup *.*


    -rr[N]  Add a data recovery record. This switch is used when creating or
            modifying archive to add a data recovery record to the archive.
            See the 'rr[N]' command description for details.


    -rv[N]  Create recovery volumes. This switch is used when creating
            a multivolume archive to generate recovery volumes.
            See the 'rv[N]' command description for details.


    -s      Create solid archive. Solid is a special archive type. Please
            refer to the appendix "Glossary" for further information.

            Example:

            create solid archive sources.rar with 512 KB dictionary,
            recursing all directories, starting with the current directory.
            Add only .asm files:

            rar a -s -md512 sources.rar *.asm -r


    -s<N>   Create solid groups using file count

            Similar to -s, but reset solid statistics after compressing
            <N> files. Usually decreases compression, but also
            decreases losses in case of solid archive damages.


    -se     Create solid groups using extension

            Similar to -s, but reset solid statistics if file extension
            is changed. Usually decreases compression, but also
            decreases losses from solid archive damages.


    -sv     Create independent solid volumes

            By default RAR tries to reset solid statistics as soon
            as possible when starting a new volume, but only 
            if a lot enough data was packed after a previous reset
            (at least a few megabytes).

            This switch forces RAR to ignore packed data size and attempt
            to reset statistics for volumes of any size. It decreases
            compression, but increases chances to extract a part of data 
            if one of solid volumes in volume set was lost or damaged.

            Note that sometimes RAR cannot reset statistics even
            using this switch. For example, it cannot be done when 
            compressing one large file split between several volumes.
            RAR is able to reset solid statistics only between separate 
            files, but not inside of single file.

            Ignored, if used to create non-volume archive.


    -sv-    Create dependent solid volumes

            Disables to reset solid statistics between volumes.

            It slightly increases compression, but significantly reduces 
            chances to extract a part of data if one of solid volumes 
            in volume set was lost or damaged.

            Ignored, if used to create non-volume archive.


    -s-     Disable solid archiving


    -sfx[name]
            Create SFX archives. If this switch is used when creating a new
            archive, a Self-Extracting archive (using a module in file
            default.sfx or specified in the switch) would be created.
            In the Windows version default.sfx should be placed in the
            same directory as the rar.exe, in Unix - in the user's
            home directory, in /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib.

            Example:

            rar a -sfxwincon.sfx myinst

            create SelF-eXtracting (SFX) archive using wincon.sfx
            SFX-module.


    -t      Test files after archiving. This switch is especially
            useful in combination with the move command, so files will be
            deleted only if archive had been successfully tested.


    -ta<date>
            Process only files modified after the specified date.

            Format of the date string is YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.
            It is allowed to insert separators like '-' or ':' to
            the date string and omit trailing fields. For example,
            the following switch is correct: -ta2001-11-20
            Internally it will be expanded to -ta20011120000000
            and treated as "files modified after 0 hour 0 minutes
            0 seconds of 20 November 2001".


    -tb<date>
            Process only files modified before the specified date.
            Format of the switch is the same as -ta<date>.


    -tk     Keep original archive date. Prevents RAR from modifying the
            archive date when changing an archive.


    -tl     Set archive time to newest file. Forces RAR to set the date of a
            changed archive to the date of the newest file in the archive.


    -tn<time>
            Process files newer than the specified time period. Format
            of the time string is:

            [<ndays>d][<nhours>h][<nminutes>m][<nseconds>s]

            For example, use switch -tn15d to process files newer
            than 15 days and -tn2h30m to process files newer than
            2 hours 30 minutes.


    -to<time>
            Process files older than the specified time period. Format
            of the switch is the same as -tn<time>.


    -u      Update files. May be used with archive extraction or creation.
            The command string "a -u" is equivalent to the command 'u', you
            could also use the switch '-u' with the commands 'm' or 'mf'. If
            the switch '-u' is used with the commands 'x' or 'e', then files
            not present on the disk and files newer than their copies on the
            disk would extracted from the archive.


    -v<size>[k|b|f|m|M]
            Create volumes with size=<size>*1000 [*1024 | *1].
            By default this switch uses <size> as thousands (1000) of bytes
            (not 1024 x bytes). You may also enter the size in kilobytes
            using the symbol 'k', in bytes using the symbol 'b',
            in megabytes - 'm', in millions of bytes - 'M' or select
            one of several predefined values using the symbol 'f'
            following the numerical value. Predefined values can be
            360, 720, 1200, 1440 or 2880 and replaced with corresponding
            floppy disk size.

            If the size is omitted, autodetection will be used.

            If volumes are created on removable media, then after
            the first volume has been created, user will be prompted
            with:

              Create next volume: Yes/No/All

            At this moment in time, you should change the disks. Answering
            'A' will cause all volumes to be created without a pause.

            By default RAR volumes have names like 'volname.partNNN.rar',
            where NNN is the volume number. Using -vn switch it is 
            possible to switch to another, extension based naming scheme,
            where the first volume file in a multi-volume set has
            the extension .rar, following volumes are numbered from .r00
            to .r99.

            When extracting or testing a multi-volume archive you must use
            only the first volume name. If there is no next volume
            on the drive and the disk is removable, the user will be
            prompted with:

             Insert disk with <next volume name>

            Insert the disk with the correct volume and press any key.

            If while extracting, the next volume is not found and volumes
            are placed on the non-removable disk, RAR will abort with
            the error message:

             Cannot find <volume name>

            Archive volumes may not be modified. The commands 'd', 'f', 'u',
            's' cannot be used with Multi-volume sets. The command 'a' may
            be used only for the creation of a new multi-volume sequence.

            It is possible, although unlikely, that the file size, of a file
            in a multi-volume set, could be greater than it's uncompressed
            size. This is due to the fact that 'storing' (no compression if
            size increases) cannot be enabled for multi-volume sets.

            Archive volumes may be Self-Extracting (SFX). Such an archive
            should be created using both the '-v' and '-sfx' switches.

            Example:

            create archive in volumes of fixed size:

            rar a -s -v1440 floparch.rar *.*

            will create solid volumes of size 1440000 bytes.


    -vd     Erase disk contents before creating volume

            All files and directories on the target disk will be erased
            when '-vd' is used.  The switch applies only to removable
            media, the hard disk cannot be erased using this switch.


    -ver[n] File version control

            Forces RAR to keep previous file versions when updating
            files in the already existing archive. Old versions are
            renamed to 'filename;n', where 'n' is the version number.

            By default, when unpacking an archive without the switch
            -ver, RAR extracts only the last added file version, which
            name does not include a numeric suffix. But if you specify
            a file name exactly, including a version, it will be also
            unpacked. For example, 'rar x arcname' will unpack only
            last versions, when 'rar x arcname file.txt;5' will unpack
            'file.txt;5', if it is present in the archive.

            If you specify -ver switch without a parameter when unpacking,
            RAR will extract all versions of all files matched to entered
            file mask. In this case a version number is not removed from
            unpacked file names. You may also extract a concrete file
            version specifying its number as -ver parameter. It will tell
            RAR to unpack only this version and remove a version number
            from file names. For example, 'rar x -ver5 arcname' will
            unpack only 5th file versions.


    -vn     Use the old style volume naming scheme

            By default RAR volumes have names like 'volname.partNNN.rar',
            where NNN is the volume number. Using -vn switch it is 
            possible to switch to another, extension based naming scheme,
            where the first volume file in a multi-volume set has
            the extension .rar, following volumes are numbered from .r00
            to .r99. It may have sense, if you are going to unpack
            an archive under the plain MS DOS, which does not allow
            more than one dot in a file name.


    -vp     Pause before each volume

            By default RAR asks for confirmation before creating or 
            unpacking next volume only for removable drives.
            This switch forces RAR to ask such confirmation always.
            It can be useful if disk space is limited and you wish
            to copy each volume to another media immediately after
            creating.


    -w<p>   Assign work directory as <p>. This switch may be used to assign
            the directory for temporary files.


    -x<f>   Exclude specified file <f>, wildcards may be used both
            in the name and file parts of file mask. You may specify
            the switch '-x' several times:

            Examples:

            1) rar a -r -x*.bak -x*.rar rawfiles

            *.bak and *.rar files will not be added to rawfiles

            2) rar a -r -x*\temp\* savec c:\*

            compress all files on the disk c: except those in temp folders


    -x@<lf> Exclude files using specified list file.

            Example:

            rar a -x@exlist.txt arch *.exe


    -y      Assume Yes on all queries.


    -z<f>   Read archive comment from file <f>.


 Limitations
 ~~~~~~~~~~~

    Pathname is limited to 259 symbols.

    Maximum archive comment length is 62000 bytes.

    Command limitations:

    The commands 'd','u','f','c','cf' will not operate with archive
    volumes.

    The command 'a' cannot be used to update an archive volume, only to
    create one.


 Exit values
 ~~~~~~~~~~~

    RAR exits with a zero code (0) in case of successful operation. The exit
    code of non-zero means the operation is cancelled due to error:

     255   USER BREAK       User stopped the process

       8   MEMORY ERROR     Not enough memory for operation

       7   USER ERROR       Command line option error

       6   OPEN ERROR       Open file error

       5   WRITE ERROR      Write to disk error

       4   LOCKED ARCHIVE   Attempt to modify an archive previously locked
                            by the 'k' command

       3   CRC ERROR        A CRC error occurred when unpacking

       2   FATAL ERROR      A fatal error occurred

       1   WARNING          Non fatal error(s) occurred

       0   SUCCESS          Successful operation (User exit)
