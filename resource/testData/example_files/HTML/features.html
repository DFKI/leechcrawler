<h2>Java 2 Platform</h2>

<a name=xmlprocessing></a>
<ul>
<li><b><a href=../guide/xml/jaxp/index.html>XML Processing</a></b>
<blockquote><b>The Java<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font> API for XML
processing</b> has been added to the Java 2 Platform.  It provides basic
support for processing XML documents through a standardized set of 
Java Platform APIs.
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name=nio></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/nio/index.html">New I/O APIs</a></b><br>

regular-expression matching, file I/O, and scalable network I/O.
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name=security></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/security/index.html">Security</a></b>
<ul>

<li>The <b><a href="../guide/security/jce/JCERefGuide.html">
Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> Cryptography Extension
(JCE)</a></b>, 
<b><a href="../guide/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html">
Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> Secure Socket Extension
(JSSE)</a></b>, and <b><a href="../guide/security/jaas/JAASRefGuide.html">
Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> Authentication
and Authorization Service (JAAS)</a></b> security features have now been 
integrated into the Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> 2 SDK, 
Standard Edition (Java 2 SDK), v 1.4 rather than being optional packages.

<li><b>There are two new security features</b>: 

<ul>
<li>The <b><a href="../guide/security/jgss/tutorials/index.html">
Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> GSS-API</a></b>
can be used for securely exchanging messages between communicating 
applications using the Kerberos V5 mechanism.
 
<li>The <b><a href="../guide/security/certpath/CertPathProgGuide.html">
Java<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> Certification Path API</a></b>
includes new classes and methods in the <code>java.security.cert</code> 
package that allow you to build and validate certification paths
(also known as &quot;certificate chains&quot;).
</ul>

<li>Due to import control restrictions, <b>the JCE jurisdiction policy files 
shipped with the Java 2 SDK, v 1.4 allow "strong" but limited cryptography 
to be used.</b> 
An "unlimited" version of these files indicating no restrictions on
cryptographic strengths is available.

<li>The JSSE implementation provided in this release includes 
strong cipher suites.  However, due to U.S. export control 
restrictions, <B>this release does not allow alternate "pluggable" 
SSL/TLS implementations to be used.</b> 
For more information, please see the  
<a href="../guide/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#Customization">JSSE Reference Guide</a>. 

<li>With the integration of JAAS into the Java 2 SDK, the 
<code>java.security.Policy</code> API handles Principal-based queries,
and the default policy implementation supports Principal-based 
<code>grant</code> entries. Thus, <b>access control can now be based
not just on what code is running, but also on <i>who</i> 
is running it</b>.

<li><b>Support for dynamic policies</b> has been added. In Java 2 SDK 
releases prior to version 1.4, classes were statically bound with
permissions by querying security policy during class loading. The
lifetime of this binding was scoped by the lifetime of the class
loader.  In version 1.4 this binding is now deferred until needed by
a security check. The lifetime of the binding is now scoped by the
lifetime of the security policy.
<li>The graphical <b>Policy Tool</b> utility has been enhanced to 
enable specifying a Principal field indicating what user is to 
be granted specified access control permissions.
</ul>

<a name="2d"></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/2d/index.html">Java 2D<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Technology</a></b>
<blockquote>
<b>Java 2D</b> includes many new features including: performance
improvements, support for hardware acceleration for offscreen images, 
a pluggable image I/O framework, a new print service API, and several new
font features.
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="imageio"></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/imageio/index.html">Image I/O Framework</a></b>
<blockquote>
The <b>Java Image I/O Framework</b> provides a pluggable architecture 
for working with images stored in files and accessed across the network. 
It offers substantially more flexibility and power than the current APIs 
for loading and saving images.
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="jps">
<li><b><a href="../guide/jps/index.html">Java Print Service API</a></b>
<blockquote>
The Java<sup><font size="-1">TM</font></sup> Print Service is a new Java
Print API that enables client and server applications to:
<ul>
<li>Discover and select print services based on their capabilities 
<li>Specify the format of print data 
<li>Submit print jobs to services that support the document type to be
printed. 
</ul>
</blockquote>
<a name="awt"></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/awt/index.html">AWT</a></b>
<blockquote>
    Changes to the AWT package center on improving the robustness,
    behavior, and performance of programs that present a graphical
    user interface.
    A new <b>focus architecture</b> replaces the previous implementation and 
    addresses many focus-related bugs caused by platform inconsistencies,
    and incompatibilities between AWT and Swing components.
    The new <b>full-screen exclusive mode API</b> supports high performance
    graphics by suspending the windowing system so that drawing can be
    done directly to the screen; a benefit to applications like games,
    or other rendering-intensive applications.
     <b>Headless support</b>
    is now enabled by new graphics environment methods that
    indicate whether a display, keyboard, and mouse can be supported in a
    graphics environment. The ability to disable native frame decorations 
    is now available for applications which need to take full control of specifying how a frame will look; when
            enabled this prevents the rendering of a native titlebar, system menu, border, or other
            native operating system dependent screen components. 
    The oft-requested <b>mouse wheel</b>, with a scroll wheel in place of 
    the middle mouse button, is enabled with new built-in Java support
    for scrolling via the mouse wheel.  Also, a new mouse wheel listener
    class allows customization of mouse wheel behavior.  The AWT package
    has been modified to be fully <b>64-bit compliant</b> and now runs on 
    Solaris machines with 64-bit and 32-bit addresses.
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="Swing"></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/swing/index.html">Swing</a></b>
<blockquote>
    Many new features have been added to Swing.  The new <b>spinner</b> component
    is a single line input field that allows the user to select a number or
    a value by cycling through a sequence of values using a tiny pair of up/down arrow buttons.
    The new <b>formatted text field</b> component allows formatting of dates,
    numbers, and strings, such as a text field that accepts only decimal money values.
    The <b>Windows look and feel</b> implementation is updated to track features
    available in the 2000/98 versions.
    A new <b>drag and drop architecture</b> provides seamless drag and drop
    support between components as well as an easy way to implement drag and
    drop in your customized Swing components - writing a couple of methods
    which describe the particulars of your data model is all that is required.
    Swing's progress bar component has been enhanced to support an
    indeterminate state; rather than showing the degree of completeness,
    the <b>indeterminate progress bar</b> uses constant animation to show that
    a time-consuming operation is occurring. Due to great customer demand,
    the tabbed pane component has been enhanced to support <b>scrollable tabs</b>.
    With this feature enabled, if all the tabs will not fit within a single tab run,
    the tabbed pane component will display a single, scrollable run of tabs, instead
    of wrapping the tabs onto multiple runs.  The <b>popup and popup factory</b> classes,
    which were previously package private, have been exposed and made public so
    that programmers may customize or create their own popups.  The new <b>focus
    architecture</b> is fully integrated into Swing.
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name=dnd></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/dragndrop">Drag and Drop</a></b>
<blockquote>
Swing has added support for data transfer between
applications. A drag and drop operation is a data transfer request 
that has been specified by a gesture with a
graphical pointing device. In the case of copy/paste, data transfer 
is often initiated with the keyboard. The ability
to transfer data takes two forms: Drag and drop (DnD) support and 
clipboard transfer via cut/copy/paste.  See 
<a href="../guide/swing/1.4/dnd.html"><b>Swing Data Transfer</b></a>.
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name=logging></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/util/logging/index.html">Logging API</a></b>
<blockquote>
The Java Logging APIs facilitate software servicing and maintenance 
at customer sites by producing log reports suitable for analysis by 
end users, system administrators, field service engineers, and 
software development teams. The Logging APIs capture information 
such as security failures, configuration errors, performance bottlenecks, 
and/or bugs in the application or platform.
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name=jws></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/jws/index.html">Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Web Start Product</a></b>
<blockquote>
The Java Web Start product is a new application-deployment technology 
that is bundled with J2SE 1.4.0. 
With Java Web Start, you launch applications simply by clicking on a
Web page link. If the application is not present on your computer,
Java Web Start automatically downloads all necessary files. It then
caches the files on your computer so the application is always ready to
be relaunched anytime you want -- either from an icon on your
desktop or from the browser link. And no matter which method you
use to launch the application, the most current version of the
application is always presented to you. 
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name=persistence></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/beans/index.html">Long-term Persistence 
of JavaBeans Components</a></b>
<blockquote>
The new persistence model is designed to handle the process of 
converting a graph of beans to and from a persistent form. 
The new API is suitable for creating archives of graphs of
JavaBeans components as textual representations of their properties. 
See 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/beans/changes14.html">API 
Enhancements to the JavaBeans Component API</a>.

</blockquote>
<p>
<a name=jdbc></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/jdbc/index.html">JDBC 3.0 API</a></b>
<blockquote>
The JDBC 3.0 API, comprised of packages <tt>java.sql</tt> and 
<tt>javax.sql</tt>, provides universal data access from the Java programming 
language. Using the JDBC 3.0 API, you can access virtualy any data 
source, from relational databases to spreadsheets and flat files. JDBC technology also provides a common base on which tools and alternative interfaces
can be built. 
<p>
New features include the ability to set savepoints in a transaction, to keep
result sets open after a transaction is committed, to reuse prepared statements,
to get metadata about the parameters to a prepared statement, to retrieve
keys that are automatically generated, and to have multiple result sets open
at one time.  There are two new JDBC data types, BOOLEAN and DATALINK, with
the DATALINK type making it possible to manage data outside of a data source.
This release also establishes the relationship between the JDBC Service Provider
Interface and the Connector architechture.
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name=assertions></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/lang/assert.html">Assertion Facility</a></b>
<blockquote>
An assertion facility has been added to the Java 2 Platform. 
Assertions are boolean expressions that the programmer believes to be true
concerning the state of a computer program. For example, after sorting a
list, the programmer might assert that the list is in ascending order.
Evaluating assertions at runtime to confirm their validity is one of the most
powerful tools for improving code quality, as it quickly uncovers the
programmer's misconceptions concerning a program's behavior.
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name=preferences></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/lang/preferences.html">Preferences API</a></b>
<blockquote>
This new feature is a simple API for managing user preference and 
configuration data. Applications require preference and configuration 
data to adapt to different users, environments and needs. Applications 
need a way to store, retrieve, and modify this data.  This need is met 
by the Preferences API.  The Preferences API is intended to replace 
most common uses of class <tt>java.util.Properties</tt>, rectifying many 
of its deficiencies, while retaining its light weight. 
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name=standards></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/standards/index.html">Endorsed Standards 
Override Mechanism</b></a>
<blockquote>
      An <em>endorsed standard</em> is a Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup
> 
      API defined through a standards process other than the 
      <a href="http://www.jcp.org/">Java 
      Community Process</a><sup><font size="-2">SM</font></sup> 
     (JCP<sup><font size="-2">SM</font></sup>). 
      Because endorsed standards are defined outside the JCP, it 
      is anticipated that such standards may be revised between 
      releases of the Java 2 Platform.  In order to take advantage of 
      new revisions to endorsed standards, developers and software vendors 
      may use the <a href="../guide/standards/index.html">Endorsed 
      Standards Override Mechanism</a> to provide 
      newer versions of an endorsed standard than those included 
      in the Java 2 Platform as released by Sun Microsystems. 
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name=chained-exceptions></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/lang/chained-exceptions.html">Chained Exception 
Facility</a></b>
<blockquote>
This new facility provides 
a common API to record the fact that one exception caused
another, to access causative exceptions, and to acess the 
entire "causal chain" as part of the standard stack backtrace, ensuring that
preexisting programs will provide this information with no additional effort
on the part of their authors.
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="vm"></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/vm/index.html">Java Virtual Machines</a></b>
<blockquote>
The Java virtual machines in this release include several enhancements.
<ul>
<li>Signal-chaining facility.
<li>64-bit support on Solaris<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>-SPARC<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> platform edition.
<li>Error-reporting mechanism.
<li>New command-line option for performing additional Java Native 
Interface (JNI) checks.
<li>New facility for logging garbage-collection events.
</ul> 
The Classic virtual machine is no longer shipped as part of the 
Java 2 SDK.
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="performance"></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/performance/index.html">Performance</a></b>
<blockquote>
This release includes performance enhancements in many areas of 
the platform.  See <a href="../guide/performance/speed.html">Performance 
Enhancements</a> for a description of some of them.
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="networking"></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/net/index.html">Networking Support, Including IPv6</a></b>
<blockquote>

<a href="../guide/net/enhancements14.html">New features</a> include 
support for IPv6 in TCP- and UDP-based applications, 
and support for unconnected/unbound sockets, allowing more flexible socket 
creation, binding, and connection. A mechanism called Java Secure Socket 
Extension provides encryption for data sent via sockets, and a new class, 
<a href="../api/java/net/URI.html"><code>URI</code></a>, allows URI 
construction and parsing without the presence of a protocol 
handler. The FTP Protocol Handler has been overhauled for conformity to 
current standards. The default character set is now UTF8, and APIs have 
been added to enable other character schemes. 

<p>A new class, <a href="../api/java/net/NetworkInterface.html"><code>NetworkInterface</code></a>, allows enumeration of interfaces and addresses, 
and JNDI DNS SP Support in <a href="../api/java/net/InetAddress.html"><code>InetAddress</code></a> enables applications to configure a pure 
Java name service provider. TCP out-of-band data provides support for legacy 
applications; a UDP Connection function registers destination address with 
the OS, enabling asynchronous errors to be returned on the UDP socket; and 
full SOCkS V5 and V4 TCP support includes auto-negotiation with the proxy 
for which version to use. In addition, there are improvements to streaming, 
request and response headers processing, and error handling.

<p>
<a name="rmi"></a>
<li><b><a href="../guide/rmi/index.html">RMI</a></b>
<blockquote>
	<b>Server-side Stack Traces Now Retained in Remote Exceptions</b><br> 
         The RMI runtime implementation will now preserve the server-side
	 stack trace information of an exception that is thrown from a 
	 remote call, in addition to filling in the client-side stack 
	 trace as it did previous releases. Therefore, when such an 
	 exception becomes accessible to client code, its stack trace 
	 will now contain all of its original server-side trace data 
	 followed by the client-side trace.
	<p> 
	<b>Service Provider Interface for <code>RMIClassLoader</code></b><br>
	Certain static methods of
	<code>java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoader</code> now delegate their
	behavior to an instance of a new service provider interface,
	<code>java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoaderSpi</code>. This service
	provider object can be configured to augment RMI's dynamic
	class loading behavior for a given application. By default, the
	service provider implements the standard behavior of all of the
	static methods in <code>RMIClassLoader</code>. See the class
	documentation of <code><a href="../api/java/rmi/server/RMIClassLoader.html">RMIClassLoader</a></code> and
	<code><a href="../api/java/rmi/server/RMIClassLoaderSpi.html">RMIClassLoaderSpi</a></code> for more details.
	<p>
	<b>Dynamic Server Host Name</b><br>
	The <code>java.rmi.server.hostname</code> property can now be 
	dynamically updated to indicate that future exports should use a 
	new host name. Therefore, the new host name value will be contained
        in the stub for an object that is exported after the property is 
	updated.

    <b>Full Speed Debugging Support</b><br>
    The 
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/hotspot/">
        Java HotSpot[TM] virtual machine 
    </a>
    now uses "full-speed debugging". In the previous version of HotSpot, when
    debugging was enabled, the program executed using only the interpreter. Now,
    the full performance advantage of HotSpot
    Technology is available to programs running with debugging enabled.
    The improved performance allows long running programs to
    be more easily debugged. It also allows testing to proceed
    at full speed and the launch of a debugger to occur on an exception.
  
    <p>
    <b>HotSwap</b><br>
      This feature has been added to allow a class to be updated while under the control of a debugger.
    <p>
    <b>Instance Filters</b><br>
      <code>EventRequests</code> now have the capability of specifying an instance filter, which 
      restricts the events generated by the request to those in which the currently executing 
      instance is the object specified.
    <p>
    <b>Support For Debugging Other Languages</b><br>
       The Java Platform Debugger Architecture has been extended so that non-Java programming 
       language source, which is translated to Java programming language source, can be debugged in the
       future.

<blockquote>
Java Plug-in 1.4 offers the following new features: support of HTTPS 
through Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) rather than the browser; 
enhanced applet caching so that other files, such as GIF, JPEG, AU, 
etc., can be cached as part of the download in addition to JAR and 
class files; applet persistence so that applets may persist across 
browser page changes; various applet-compatibility 
enhancements to allow most JDK 1.1 applets to run seemlessly in Java 2; 
and on Microsoft Windows platforms, support in Java Plug-in for launching 
applets using the <tt>&lt;APPLET&gt;</tt> tag.
<p>
Version 1.4 also provides access to the DOM via standard, w3c-defined 
interfaces; assertion and logging support; applet usability enhancements, 
including a customizable progress bar for applet loading; and enhanced 
options in the Java Console to allow dynamic reconfiguration of proxy 
settings, the policy file, etc., while the applet is running.

<blockquote>
The collections framework has several enhancements in Java 2 SDK 1.4, 
including a marker interface to advertise random access, an identity-based 
(rather than equality-based) Map, insertion-order-preserving Map and 
Set implementations, and several new algorithms for manipulating and 
returning values from lists. See <a href="../guide/collections/changes4.html">Collections Framework Enhancements</a> for details.

have been rewritten for higher performance.  Reflective
invocations and instantiations are several times faster than in
previous releases.

<a name=jni></a>
<li><a href="../guide/jni/index.html"><b>Java Native Interface</b></a>
<blockquote>
A few changes have been made to JNI in v 1.4.
First, the version number has been incremented
and the specification of <tt>JNI_OnLoad</tt> updated accordingly.
Second, JNI has been enhanced to reflect a new feature of the 
<tt>java.nio</tt> package: <i>direct buffers</i>. The contents of a
direct buffer can, potentially, reside in native memory outside 
of the ordinary garbage-collected heap. Finally, the new Invocation Interface 
routine <tt>AttachCurrentTreadAsDaemon</tt> allows native code to attach 
a daemon thread to the virtual machine; this is useful when the VM should 
not wait for this thread to exit upon shutdown. 
See <a href="../guide/jni/jni-14.html"><b>JNI Enhancements</b></a> for 
more on these enhancements.

<h2>Tools and Utilities</h2>
<a name=tools></a>
<blockquote>
See <a href=../tooldocs/tools-changes.html><b>Tool Changes</b></a> for 
details on the changes summarized here. 
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li> The <a href="../tooldocs/solaris/java.html"><b>java</b></a> 
application launcher supports 
command-line options for support of the new Assertions Facility. 
On the Solaris<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Operating Environment 
(SPARC<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Platform Edition) new 
command-line options are available for specifying 64-bit or 
32-bit operation.  On all platforms, new option <tt>-Xloggc:<i>file</i></tt> 
logs each garbage-collection event in the specified file. 
Also on all platforms, the new option <tt>-Xcheck:jni</tt> performs additional
checks for Java Native Interface (JNI) functions at the cost of some
performance degradation

<p><li>The <a href="../tooldocs/solaris/javadoc.html"><b>javadoc</b></a>
tool has several new tags, a dozen new options, smarter inheriting 
of doc comments, more control over HTML output, improvements to 
the Doclet API, better error messages, dozens of bug fixes, and 
is easier to run.
For more details, see <a href=../tooldocs/javadoc/whatsnew-1.4.html>What's 
New in Javadoc 1.4</a>.
Downloaded separately from the SDK, the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javadoc/mifdoclet/">MIF doclet</a>
has had a major upgrade -- it generates API documentation 
in FrameMaker and PDF format.

<p><li> The <a href="../tooldocs/solaris/native2ascii.html"><b>native2ascii</b></a>
tool contains bug fixes to now correctly 
process source files encoded with Unicode encoding.  

<p><li>The <a href="../guide/rmi-iiop/toJavaPortableUG.html"><b>idlj</b></a> tool now generates server-side bindings following the <em>Portable Servant Inheritance Model</em>.  
This change involves producing new POA bindings by default.  A new command-line
option is added to enable you to continue to generate backwards-compatible server-side
bindings.  To learn more about the <a href="../guide/idl/POA.html">Portable Servant Inheritance Model</a>, follow the link.

<p><li>The <a href="../guide/idl/orbd.html"><b>orbd</b></a> tool, or <em>Object Request Broker Daemon</em>, is a new alternative tool for the Transient
 Naming Service, <tt>tnameserv</tt>.  ORBD includes both a Transient Naming Service 
 and a Persistent Naming Service.  The <B>orbd</B> tool is used to enable
 clients to transparently locate and invoke persistent objects on servers in the 
 CORBA environment. The <b>orbd</b> tool incorporates the functionality of a Server Manager, 
 an Interoperable Naming Service, and a Bootstrap Name Server.  When used in conjunction
  with the <tt>servertool</tt>, the Server Manager locates, registers, and activates
   a server when a client wants to access the server. 

 
 <p><li>The <a href="../guide/idl/servertool.html"><b>servertool</b></a> is new to this release.  The <b>servertool</b> provides 
 an ease-of-use interface for application programmers to register, unregister, 
 startup, and shutdown a server.  

<p><li>The <a href="../tooldocs/solaris/rmic.html"><b>rmic</b></a> compiler has a new option to enable Portable Object Adapter, or <em>POA</em> support for Remote Method Invocation.  The POA enables portability among vendor ORBs, among other uses.  To lea














rn more about the <a href="../guide/idl/POA.html">POA</a>, follow the link.  To enable POA support with the <tt>rmic</tt> compiler, use the arguments <tt>rmic -iiop -poa</tt>.

<p><li>The graphical <b>Policy Tool</b> utility has been enhanced
to enable specifying a Principal field indicating what user is to be
granted specified access control permissions.
